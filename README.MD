# WattyPatty

A Proof of Concept program to make an archival of Wattpad stories, this is, as said before, a proof of concept, you may "download" stories using it, still, it is not usable due to it not being implemented to parse the HTML into a story markdown or a final html.

After all, if you know enough programming, you can do it yourself very easily by just reading the resulting JSON file, this may be added as an external/additional applet in the future, but there are no clear plans for this thing on the future.

This project uses PuppeteerSharp and PuppeteerSharpExtra to process and obtain data from Wattpad's website via WebScraping.

There has also been some reverse engineering of their public, undocumented API, although really minimal.
